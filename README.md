**E-Puck Robot Maze Solver**

**Description:**
This project involves programming an E-Puck robot to navigate through a maze, avoid obstacles, collect boxes, and follow a line using various sensors and actuators. The robot is equipped with infrared sensors, proximity sensors, light sensors, a camera, and ground sensors to perceive its environment and make decisions accordingly.

**Features:**
1. **Maze Navigation:** The robot is capable of navigating through a maze environment using infrared sensors to detect obstacles and determine the optimal path to follow.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance:** It employs proximity sensors to detect obstacles in its path and adjusts its trajectory to avoid collisions.

3. **Box Detection and Handling:** The robot can detect boxes using a camera and make decisions based on their colors. It is programmed to collect specific boxes while avoiding others.

4. **Line Following:** Utilizing ground sensors, the robot can follow lines marked on the maze floor, enabling it to navigate through designated paths.

**Dependencies:**
- Webots Simulator: The project is developed and tested using the Webots simulation environment.
- Python Controller: The robot's behavior is programmed using Python scripts within the Webots environment.

**Instructions:**
1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure that Webots Simulator is installed on your system.
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Execution:**
   - Open the Webots Simulator.
   - Load the provided robot model and world file.
   - Run the Python controller script within Webots to start the simulation.

3. **Interacting with the Robot:**
   - The robot will begin navigating through the maze autonomously.
   - Observe the console output for debugging information and status updates.
   - You can modify the code to tweak the robot's behavior or add new functionalities.
